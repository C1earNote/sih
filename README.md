## What should be the key benefits
1. Efficient Information Retrieval: The chatbot will quickly provide accurate information on topics like admissions, fees, scholarships, and recommendations based on previous years' cutoffs. It will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) for voice-based assistance in English, with potential expansion to Hindi and other regional languages for broader accessibility.

2. Enhanced User Experience: An intuitive, easy-to-navigate interface will be designed to ensure quick access to information. The interface will be accessible on common platforms and understand natural language, enhancing user-friendliness.

3. Reduced Workload: By automating responses to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), the chatbot will reduce the workload on department staff, enabling them to focus on more complex tasks.

4. Data Insights: The chatbot will collect data from user interactions, providing valuable insights to help the department identify common concerns and improve services accordingly.
